# Changelog

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- `@nocoo/bogo` published with a missing `bin` entry — npm silently
  rejected `"./dist/index.js"` (the leading `./` is invalid) so 0.4.0
  installs cleanly but exposes no `bogo` command. Drop the `./`
  prefix and normalise the repository URL to `git+https://…` to
  silence the related publish warning.

### Added
- `CLIP_BASE_URL` now overrides `bogo login` too (clip v1.1.0
  upstream). Self-hosted deployments can redirect every CLI call —
  login included — with one env var. Docs: `docs/features/03-self-hosting.md`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **`bogo` CLI** — generated from the repo-root `clip.yaml` by
  [clip](https://github.com/nocoo/clip), covering the full `/api/*` surface
  (workspaces / persons / fields / doc-types / documents / tags / me).
  Source code is **not** vendored here; this repo carries the schema and
  the worker-side auth surface required to make the generated CLI work.
- **`/api/auth/cli` browser-login endpoint** (`packages/worker/src/routes/auth.ts`)
  — handles the loopback callback for clip's `browser-login` auth type,
  mints a `bogo_<base64url(32)>` bearer token, persists only
  `sha256(plain).hex` plus a 12-char display prefix to D1, and 302s back
  with `api_key`/`state`/`email`. Refuses requests whose `authMethod ===
  "bearer"` (403) so a leaked CLI token cannot self-mint another.
- **`api_tokens` D1 table** (`migrations/0004_api_tokens.sql`) — hash-only
  token store with `revoked_at` / `expires_at` columns and indexes on
  `owner_email` and `token_hash`.
- **Bearer branch in `access-auth.ts` middleware** — runs BEFORE the
  localhost shortcut so a revoked CLI token on wrangler dev still 401s
  instead of falling through to `dev@localhost`. Variables now carry an
  `authMethod` discriminator (`"bearer" | "cf-access-jwt" | "localhost"`).
  Non-`bogo_` Bearer values fall through to the CF Access JWT path
  unchanged.
- **`sha256Hex` utility** (`packages/worker/src/utils/hash.ts`) — Web
  Crypto–based SHA-256 hex digest used by the bearer branch and
  `/api/auth/cli`.
- **Query → body CSV bridge** in `documents.ts` (POST `/`) and `fields.ts`
  (POST `/`, PUT `/:id`) for `personIds` / `options`. clip codegen
  cannot send arrays in body, so the CLI sends them as comma-separated
  query strings; the route splits the CSV into the body field before zod
  validation. Body always wins over query for non-CLI callers.
- **CLI bearer auth lifecycle E2E** (`packages/worker/test/e2e/auth.test.ts`):
  login via `/api/auth/cli`, present bearer to `/api/me`, revoke via D1
  `UPDATE`, assert same bearer now 401s. Plus the localhost fallback
  baseline and the bearer-self-mint refusal case.
- **Generated CLI smoke E2E** (`tests/cli-e2e/smoke.test.ts`) — drives an
  end-to-end run against a real wrangler dev with a clip-generated CLI:
  fake `open`/`xdg-open` so cli-base's openBrowser fails and emits the
  login URL; loopback fetch completes the callback; CRUD chain over
  generated commands; same `--persist-to` for the revoke UPDATE so the
  401 assertion is real.
- **clip.yaml validator gate** (`scripts/check-clip-yaml.ts` + new CI step
  in `coverage-gates`) — round-trips the repo-root `clip.yaml` through
  `clip generate` so a future yaml edit that breaks codegen fails the
  gate. CI checks out `nocoo/clip` as a sibling for the runner fallback;
  `BOGO_REQUIRE_CLI_E2E=1` makes a missing clip a hard CI failure.
- **Pre-push CLI E2E stage** — `bun run test:cli-e2e` runs alongside the
  existing L2 + G2 stages. Locally bypassable via `BOGO_SKIP_CLI_E2E=1`;
  CI exports `BOGO_REQUIRE_CLI_E2E=1` so the skip toggle is a no-op there.
- **New `cli-e2e` CI job** that checks out bogo + `nocoo/clip` siblings,
  builds the static UI, and runs the smoke E2E under
  `BOGO_REQUIRE_CLI_E2E=1`.

### Changed
- **Worker access-auth middleware** now resolves identity through three
  ordered branches (bearer → localhost → CF Access JWT). Order is
  load-bearing: any other order lets revoked CLI tokens fall through to a
  shortcut. The localhost dev shortcut and the CF Access JWT path retain
  their existing behaviour and `userEmail` semantics; the only addition
  is the `c.set("authMethod", …)` calls so `/api/auth/cli` can refuse
  bearer-driven self-minting.
- **Endpoints documentation** (`docs/architecture/03-system-architecture.md`)
  now records the dual identity model, the loopback callback flow, the
  bearer self-mint refusal, and the production CF Access Bypass policy
  requirement (`Authorization starts with "Bearer bogo_"`).
- **Documents POST and Fields POST/PUT route signatures** keep the same
  zod schemas; the new CSV query → body bridging happens before zod
  validation and is transparent to existing callers.
- **README** gains a top-level CLI section pointing at `clip.yaml`, the
  minimum workflow, the production CF Access requirement, and the
  manual v1 revoke flow.
- **CLAUDE.md**: architecture diagram updated to show `/api/auth/cli` and
  the dual-identity `/api/*`; new "CLI bearer bypass policy" subsection
  under Cloudflare Access 配置; Testing table adds L4 CLI E2E; pre-push
  description updated.

### Security
- CLI plaintext tokens cross the wire exactly once (in the `api_key`
  query parameter on the loopback redirect) and are never persisted in
  D1. The `prefix` column stores the first 12 chars for display in logs
  / `auth show`; full reverse lookup is not possible from D1 alone.
- `credentials.json` written by the generated CLI is `chmod 0600`.
- The route-coverage gate regex (`scripts/check-route-coverage.ts`) was
  tightened so `c.get("authMethod")` / `c.set("userEmail")` Hono
  Variables accessors are no longer mis-parsed as `GET /api/...` routes.

### Notes
- v1 revocation is **manual** — `UPDATE api_tokens SET revoked_at=…`
  against the live D1. The token-management UI and `/api/auth/tokens*`
  endpoints (list / create / DELETE) are Phase 2 scope and explicitly
  not in this release.
- The CLI source itself is generated; nothing in this repo runs
  `bun link` of the generated CLI into the developer environment to keep
  dev envs clean.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Person avatars as first-class data**
  - `persons.avatar_url` column (migration `0003_persons_avatar.sql`)
  - `PersonAvatar`: deterministic letter avatar with stable djb2 name → 8-color palette mapping; uploaded URL takes precedence and falls back on load failure
  - `PersonChip` (left avatar + name + optional subtitle/× button) and `PersonAvatarCluster` (overlapping avatars + "+N" overflow) — the only sanctioned person-rendering surfaces
  - `EditPersonPanel` gains an Avatar URL field with live preview
- **YAML frontmatter rendering**
  - Markdown preview auto-detects a leading `--- ... ---` block and renders it as a compact property table; arrays render as chips, nested objects collapse to inline JSON
  - Malformed YAML and mid-document fences silently strip / fall through to normal markdown
  - `js-yaml` `JSON_SCHEMA` keeps scalars verbatim — date-shaped strings like `2026-05-30` are preserved instead of being coerced into Date ISO strings
- **DocType picker on the document editor** — colored pill in the right inspector, full set/unset menu via new `DocTypePicker` component
- **Document list shows associated people** — overlapping avatar cluster on each row (later removed per spec; see Changed)
- **Frontmatter-style YAML examples and component classes** documented in `docs/architecture/09-css-conventions.md`

### Changed
- **Document editor — full GitHub-style redesign**
  - Two-column layout: editor + preview in main, fixed inspector on the right with grouped Type / Tags / People / Event date / History
  - Inline-editable title (24px, hover shows pencil), back link on its own row, save chip with dirty/all-saved status indicator
  - Viewport-locked height chain in `DashboardLayout`: long content scrolls inside the editor and preview panes instead of pushing the whole page
  - Padding tightened so the editor inherits the layout card's `p-5` instead of double-padding
  - Header strip aligns to column 0; control heights unified at `h-8`
- **Markdown rendering rewrite**
  - Replaced the 50-line regex stub with a proper `marked` v17 renderer mirroring firefly's architecture: HTML escaped, URLs sanitised, heading anchor ids, external links open in new tab
  - `prose-invert` now scoped to `dark:`, fixing the white-bold-on-white-bg bug in light mode
  - `.markdown-surface` extracted as a `@layer components` semantic class; `<select>` chrome moved from `@layer base` to `@layer components`
- **CSS structure cleanup**
  - `index.css` reorganised into 6 numbered sections (imports / variants / theme tokens / design tokens / base / components)
  - Document list rows aligned to `EditPersonPanel` panel vocabulary (`bg-secondary` + `rounded-xl` + `shadow-sm`); titles wrap to two lines
  - Person nodes keep an opaque `bg-secondary` background when selected (no more dotted-canvas bleed-through)
- **PersonDocTimeline → Documents panel** — same panel vocabulary as `EditPersonPanel`, doc cards show title (2-line) + type chip + version + tag badges
- **Worker `GET /persons/:id/documents`** — joins `tag_documents` so each doc carries its tag list
- **Worker `GET /documents`** — embeds `personIds[]` per document; nested `if (tagIds && ids.length > 0)` collapsed to a single check
- **Person `update` API surfaces** — `PersonListVM.update` / `EditPersonPanel.onUpdate` widened to `UpdatePersonInput` so the shared schema is the single source of truth

### Fixed
- White bold-text-on-white-background in markdown preview (light mode)
- Editor + preview being pushed past the viewport when content was long
- Frontmatter `2026-05-30` no longer rendered as `2026-05-30T00:00:00.000Z`
